      "When you are trying to sleep, pay attention, you will be teleported to one of the two dimensions at a low rate,",
      "the first one is almost the same as the overworld, which means once you find a treasure, you can take the another one in this through dreaming.",
      "The second is a mixed world,in another word, disordered. you will probably find end_city or ghost_tower here."

    "warning": [
      "Without sheep talisman in offhand, during teleporting to the dimension you will leave some item and when you wake up, you'll take them back.",
      "However, if you dead in the dimension you will lose the left items. Oh by the way, you will be given some items too. for it's a dream.",
      "In some approach, you may keep the given items while leaving, But how?",
      " So kill ender dragon to take the sheep talisman would be a better choice. or put items into chests and dig a hole to waiting for wake up."
